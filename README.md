# Basic Recipe Page using Grid for the first time
---
## Learning Outcome : 
### I made this page following a lecture video and put in filler text and images to follow along. I didn't really like the design of the page, but this was a great page to learn how to css using grid. The knowledge you will need to work on this page is HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid. Some of the challenges I faced was I tried to use a vertical image and it messed up the css while I was following along so I ended up switching to a horizontal image to make things easier. In the future I am going to implement another page using grid on my own following a figma file and I am excited to see what challenges I face and what mistakes I will learn from. I have to say that learning grid at first was scary, but after working with it its really not that bad. I really look forward to utilizing it more in the future. Don't be afraid to approach topics you are unfamiliar with because things you may be struggling with will only make you stronger. Get out of that comfort zone and keep on learning!

### To get started I would recommend for you to make all your pages first and set up its HTML structure. Then get all your images and set up your git up repo before starting to CSS you page. You can use my code if you want to fork it, but I would recommend starting from scratch and seeing what you can implement first because doing it yourself is the best way to learn.
